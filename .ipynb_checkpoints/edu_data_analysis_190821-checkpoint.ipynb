    "As an exercise in performing wrangling, data exploration, and data visualization, I chose to look at publicly available datasets of California public schools and census information. While exploring, I sought to identify overperforming school populations. I define this as a school's population that faces socio-economic difficulties yet have low dropout rates.\n",

Each test, English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics is comprised of two parts: (1) a computer adaptive test and (2) a performance task; administered within a 12-week window beginning at 66 percent of the instructional year for grades three through eight, or within in a 7-week window beginning at 80 percent of the instructional year for grade eleven.

Each test, English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics is comprised of two parts: (1) a computer adaptive test and (2) a performance task; administered within a 12-week window beginning at 66 percent of the instructional year for grades three through eight, or within in a 7-week window beginning at 80 percent of the instructional year for grade eleven. The summative assessments are aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for ELA and mathematics. The tests capitalize on the strengths of computer adaptive testing-efficient and precise measurement across the full range of achievement and timely turnaround of results.\",\"test_label\":\"California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP)\",\"test_source\":\"California Department of Education\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"state_number_tested\":353941,\"grades\":[{\"breakdown_in_english\":\"Students with disabilities\",\"label\":\"12\",\"score\":12,\"state_average\":5,\"state_average_label\":\"5\",\"percentage\":null,\"number_students_tested\":51,\"grade\":\"11\",\"display_percentages\":true}]}]},\"flagged\":null,\"title\":\"Math\",\"anchor\":\"Math\"}]}],\"faq\":{\"cta\":\"Notice something missing or confusing?\",\"content\":\"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"emphasis\\\"\\u003eHow do we decide which subjects to display?\\u003c/span\\u003e We display the three tests taken by the largest number of students at this school.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cspan class=\\\"emphasis\\\"\\u003eWhat does the “State average” data show?\\u003c/span\\u003e In this chart, the state average show the state average for Students with disabilities (not for all students) across the state.

The Freshman coach is knowledgeable as is the assistant JV coach, but the other coaches unfortunately show no credible ability to lead these talented young men.  The volleyball coaching staff is knowledgeable.  The football team walked out on the program due to the coaching staff.
