# School and community features associated with low income student success

Low income students face academic challenges that affect long-term employment and upward social mobility. Fortunately, some schools provide environments for low income students to thrive. In this project, I investigated features of California (CA) public high schools and their communities that may affect low income student performance. I focused on a school's percentage of low income students that are college eligible (SPLICE). To obtain school-specific features, I acquired data from the CA public schools database and GreatSchools websites. This was supplemented with local economic characteristics from the census. Following data exploration and filtering, I built classification models to predict schools with exceptional SPLICE. Exceptional SPLICE is defined as a school achieving greater than one standard deviation above mean SPLICE across all CA high schools. A regularized logistic regression model outperformed random forest classification (F1 of 0.67 and 0.55, respectively, for the positive class). I find that schools with exceptional SPLICE are more likely to also have a high percentage of non-low income students that are college eligible, house a smaller student population, and be a charter school. CA schools of exceptional SPLICE are disproportionately located in the Bay Area and in coastal Southern California counties. Some features associated with this geographic distribution therefore contribute to exceptional SPLICE prediction. While care must be emphasized in feature interpretation, this study may add to the discussion of factors that facilitate low income student success.
