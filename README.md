## Abstract
Low income students face challenges academically which affects long-term employment and upward social mobility. Fortunately some schools and communities have provided environments for low income students to thrive. In this project, I investigated the features of California (CA) public high schools and their local areas which are associated with the school's percentage of low income students that are college eligibile (SPLICE). To obtain school-specific features, I obtained data from GreatSchools websites and from the CA public schools database. This was supplemented with local economic characteristics from publicly available census data. Identifying important features was obtained with random forest regression models.  I find that a school's college eligibility rate for all students is a significantly good predictor for low income student performance. This highlights how the right environment benefits all demographics of students. Additionally, charter status is also an important variable, with charter schools positively correlating with SPLICE. Additional statistical analysis was performed following segmentation by the highest and lowest performing schools for SPLICE. Communities with a greater proportion of workers in professional, information, or manufacturing industries were positively associated with SPLICE while the percentage of a community that was not in the labor force was negatively correlated with SPLICE. Features that had no impact on SPLICE included the percentage of students that are low income students, magnet status, student-to-teacher ratio, and a community's median household income. This study may add to further investigation of actionable factors that can facilitate low income student success.
