# CA-ed-study

Low income students face academic challenges that affect long-term employment and upward social mobility. Fortunately, some schools and communities have provided environments for low income students to thrive. In this project, I investigated the features of California (CA) public high schools and their local areas which are associated with whether a school's percentage of low income students that are college eligible (SPLICE) is exceptionally high. To obtain school-specific features, I obtained data from the CA public schools database and GreatSchools websites. This was supplemented with local economic characteristics from census data. Following data exploration and filtering, I built classification models to predict schools with exceptional SPLICE. Exceptional SPLICE is defined as a school achieving greater than one standard deviation above mean SPLICE across all CA high schools. A regularized logistic regression model outperformed random forest classification (F1 of 0.67 and 0.55, respectively, for the positive class). I find that schools with exceptional SPLICE are more likely to also have a high proportion of non-low income students that are college eligible, house a smaller student population, and be a charter school. CA schools of exceptional SPLICE are disproportionately located in the Bay Area and in coastal Southern California counties. This helps explain why features of a local community that are tied with exceptional SPLICE include a high percent of workers that use public transportation to commute, and a low percent of workers who work in the agriculture and forestry industry or the retail trade sector.  While care must be emphasized in interpretation, this study may add to the discussion of factors that facilitate low income student success.
