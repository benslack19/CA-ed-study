## Abstract
Low income students face challenges academically which affects long-term employment and upward social mobility. Fortunately some schools and communities have provided environments for low income students to thrive. In this project, I investigated the features of California (CA) public high schools and their local areas which are associated with low income student college eligibility (LISCE). To obtain school-specific features, I obtained data from GreatSchools websites and from the CA public schools database. This was supplemented with local economic characteristics from publicly available census data. Identifying important features was obtained with random forest regression models.  I find that a school's college eligibility rate for all students is a significantly good predictor for low income student performance. This highlights how the right environment benefits all demographics of students. Additionally, charter status is also an important variable, with charter schools positively correlating with LISCE. Additional statistical analysis was performed following segmentation by the highest and lowest performing schools for LISCE. Communities with a greater proportion of workers in professional, information, or manufacturing industries were positively associated with LISCE while the percentage of a community that was not in the labor force was negatively correlated with LISCE. Features that had no impact on LISCE included the percentage of students that are low income students, magnet status, student-to-teacher ratio, and a community's median household income. This study may add to further investigation of actionable factors that can facilitate low income student success.
